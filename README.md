# Web-service
A webAPI service meant to provide endpoints to the Presentation layer.  The Presentation layer will initially use its Bend End to the Front end (BFF) to make requests to this API.  Future plans are uncertain, but could lead to the Front end making calls directly.  Once that is done, the Front end app could be converted into a NodeJS app and it could lose the .NET Core back end.
